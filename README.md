# CognoRise-Infotech-Task-1-
During my internship at CognoRise Infotech, I developed a Java-based number guessing game, as my first task, that uses loops and conditional statements to compare user guesses against a randomly generated number. The game tracks attempts and provides instant feedback, demonstrating effective use of core Java functionalities.
